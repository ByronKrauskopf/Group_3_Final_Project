# About the Project
Movie Recommendation system from MovieLens dataset

With many streaming services available nowadays, building an efficient movie recommender system has become more important due to the increase in demand to create customized content for consumers. We will be using the Movielens dataset to build a movie recommender system. It contains approximately ### movie ratings of ### movies made by ### Movielens users. The main question we want to answer with the dataset is: can we accurately predict movie suggestions for users based off their previous ratings? 


### Prerequisits and Tools:
- AWS
- Postgres SQL + PgAdmin
- techology to be used
- ML Model and why
- Database type selected and why

# Getting Started

### Prerequisites ands Installation
- installation packages and software versions
- 

### Relational Database Setup
Using a database connected with AWS is a convienent way to store diffrent datasets that have relationships with each other.

Additional instructions to set up a PostgreSQL database instance with Amazon Web Services (AWS) can be found in this [link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_GettingStarted.CreatingConnecting.PostgreSQL.html).

1. Create and sign into your AWS Management console and open the Amazon RDS Console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/.
2. In the upper-right corner of the AWS Managment Console, Choose the AWS Region where you will create the DB Instance. (CHANGE STEP)
3. In the Navigation pane, choose **Databases.**
5. Choose **Create Databases.** and select the **Easy create** option.
6. On the **Create database** page, shown following, make sure that the **Standard create** option is chosen, and then choose **PostgreSQL**
7. Under **Version**, click on the dropdown menue and select PostgreSQL 12.8-R1. This allows us to select the free tier for DB template.
